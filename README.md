Overlay
=======

minimal jquery overlay

Creating an overlay with a css repeating semi-transparent png file.  This works well in IE8, Chrome, FF and Safari.
Although modern browsers support opacity, it is not implemented here.

To use:
Add your own src path to jquery either local or on a content server.
Copy overlay div into your page, modify inner div copy as needed.

The triggers are currently set to onclick of the anchor href, you could change this to a button click or another
event of your choosing.


To work on:
adding info to use JQuery append()
add css for opacity
